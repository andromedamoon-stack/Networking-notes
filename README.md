# Networking-notes


This is a repo that contains the back-ups of my notes from the Cisco Networking Academy and for Linux. These are in preperation for taking the Network+ certification and the Linux + certifcation as the foundation of my knowledge before moving onto the the AWS Developer certification and other cloud certifications.

Notes will be organized in a more presenatable manner later on + I will add a study guide and study schedule for thos interested in following the same path.
